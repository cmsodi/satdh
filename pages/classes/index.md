### Introduction

The proposed "**Four Causes of Space Exploration**" classification system organizes space-related topics into four main classes: Objects, Actors, Purposes and Fields.

- Objects: Refers to spacecraft, launchers (devices to propel objects into space), and stations (facilities for habitation or spacecraft control).
- Actors: Involves businesses in the private sector, the public sector (government agencies and regulatory bodies), and the scientific community.
- Purposes: Includes commercial use of outer space, research to enhance our understanding of the universe, and space-based services to Earth.
- Fields: Encompasses strategies (policies and approaches for space exploration goals), programs (initiatives to exploit and explore space), and technologies (breakthroughs enabling space exploration).

### Objects

*The Objects class refers to the physical entities involved in space exploration.* 

It includes Spacecrafts designed for space travel, Launchers used to propel objects into space, and Stations such as spaceports or bases on celestial bodies.

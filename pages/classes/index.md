{{< html "The Four Causes of Space Exploration.svg" >}}

### Introduction

The proposed "Four Causes of Space Exploration" classification system draws inspiration from Aristotle's four causes and organizes space-related topics into four main classes: **Objects, Purposes, Actors, and Fields**.

Each class includes three terms, defined below.
Depending on its contents, more than one term may be associated with each article.

Note that this classification system is not intended to be an exhaustive or definitive framework. It serves as a tool to organize and categorize the articles of this site, offering a structured approach for comprehending the various aspects of space exploration.

### Objects

**The objects class refers to the physical entities involved in space exploration.**

They include spacecraft, designed for space travel and exploration; launchers, devices used to propel objects into space; stations, facilities for spacecraft control or human habitation in space.

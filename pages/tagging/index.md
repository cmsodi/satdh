Putting things or ideas into different groups is a good way to keep information organized and make it easier to find. Taxonomies, which are sets of categories organized in a hierarchy, are often used to help with this. A good taxonomy can make it easier for people to find the information they need and help make sure things are put in the right category. An important part of a taxonomy's effectiveness is how easy it is for users to move around and find information.
There is no one way to put things into groups. The best way to do this is to adapt to the situation.
Items on this site are sorted into four different groups by the labels shown below.

## The Objects

{{< admonition type=abstract title="click here to expand" open=false >}}

### Spacecraft

A spacecraft is a vehicle or machine designed to function in space. It can include a wide range of objects, such as satellites, probes, rovers, landers, and human-rated vehicles like the International Space Station (ISS) and the Space Shuttle. It can also include smaller components, like modules and sub-systems, that are used in a larger spacecraft. The term "spacecraft" is used to encompass all types of vehicles or machines that are intended for use in space.

### Launch Base (LaunchB)

The launch bases can be Ground-based, Naval, Airborne.
- Ground-based launch bases are facilities located on the Earth's surface and are used for launching rockets and spacecraft into space.
- Naval launch bases are facilities located on ships or submarines and are used for launching rockets or missiles, usually for submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and other types of missiles.
- Airborne launch bases are facilities located on aircraft or airships and are used for launching rockets or missiles. They are typically used for aerial reconnaissance and surveillance missions and for delivering payloads into space.

### Launch vehicle (LaunchV)

A launch vehicle is any type of vehicle or machine used to deliver a payload into space. This can include a wide range of vehicles, including rockets as well as other types of vehicles, as Spaceplanes, Balloons, Launchers attached to aircraft.
- Spaceplanes are aircraft-like vehicles that are designed to take off from a runway and fly into space. 
- Balloons are large, high-altitude balloons that can be used to carry payloads into the upper atmosphere or near-space environment. 
- Launchers attached to aircraft are payloads that are attached to aircraft and dropped from high altitudes. The payload is then ignited to reach space.

### Space station (SpaceSt)


A space station is a human-made, artificial satellite or facility that orbits a celestial body or is located on its surface and serves as a long-term habitat for crew members. It typically includes living quarters, work areas, and various systems for life support, communication, and scientific research. Space stations are designed to be occupied for extended periods of time and are used for a variety of purposes, including scientific research, technology development, and international cooperation. They may be visited by crew members on a rotating basis and may be resupplied regularly with food, water, and other essential supplies. Space stations provide a unique environment for conducting research in microgravity or in harsh extraterrestrial environments, as well as for observing and studying the celestial bodies and their surroundings.

### Earth station (EarthSt)

An earth station is a ground-based facility used for communication with and control of satellites, spacecraft, and other objects in space. They play a critical role in the operation of satellite-based communication systems, navigation systems, and Earth observation systems. They are used to track, control, and communicate with satellites and other spacecraft, as well as to receive and transmit data, images, and other information. Earth stations can be either fixed or mobile, and may be operated by government agencies, commercial companies, or other organizations.

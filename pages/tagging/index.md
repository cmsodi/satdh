Putting things or ideas into different groups is a good way to keep information organized and make it easier to find. Taxonomies, which are sets of categories organized in a hierarchy, are often used to help with this. A good taxonomy can make it easier for people to find the information they need and help make sure things are put in the right category. An important part of a taxonomy's effectiveness is how easy it is for users to move around and find information.
There is no one way to put things into groups. The best way to do this is to adapt to the situation.
Items on this site are sorted into four different groups by the labels shown below.

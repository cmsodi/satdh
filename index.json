Manned spacecraft can perform space activities independently or as a ferry “ ” between the ground and the space station, and can also perform joint flights after docking with the space station or other spacecraft. The Shenzhou spacecraft is a series of manned spacecraft developed by China itself. It was included in the national plan in 1992 and has reached or surpassed the international third-generation manned spacecraft technology. Manned spacecraft design is based on what tasks to perform or complete. The Shenzhou spacecraft uses a three cabin section, built from the return cabin, orbital cabin, propulsion cabin and additional sections. The propulsion module, also known as the power module, provides energy and power for the regulation and return of the spacecraft’s orbit. The return module is the astronauts’ cockpit during the ascent and return of the spacecraft, and it is also the command and control center for the entire spacecraft. The return module not only withstands various stress and environmental conditions during takeoff, climb and orbit phases like other cabins, but also prohibits overload deceleration and aerodynamic heating during reentry and return phases. The Orbital Module is a workplace where astronauts conduct scientific experiments and technical experiments in spacecraft orbit. Contains various experimental tools and equipment. When the spaceship runs by itself, it is also the astronaut’s life area. After leaving the main body of the spacecraft in the orbital compartment of the first Shenzhou spacecraft, it will remain in space to continue working for a period of time to provide ground personnel with scientific research data. The additional paragraph is also called the transition paragraph, which exists on the first Shenzhou spacecraft, and is mainly used to complete the handover with other spacecraft. Also, other tools can be installed for space detection. Starting with the Shenzhou 7 spacecraft, the additional section has been replaced by a formal space docking agency. The three segments will perform their functions during the independent flight of the Shenzhou spacecraft. When the Shenzhou spacecraft and the space station are docked to form a combination, the division of labor in the cabin will be adjusted. For example, after forming a combination, astronauts do not have to work and live in the orbital module. The current Shenzhou series of spacecraft is launched by the Long March 2 F rocket specially developed for it. The launch base is the Gansu Wine Spring Satellite Launch Center.

<p>Rockets that use only solid rocket engines are mostly preferred for applications that require a quick and reliable launch. The lack of complex liquid fuel systems makes them ideal for missions where there is limited preparation time or where a fast response is needed, such as military launches or emergency satellite deployments. Additionally, solid rocket engines provide a high thrust-to-weight ratio, making them well-suited for launches that require a large amount of initial propulsion. They are also used for launching small payloads, where the weight and complexity of liquid engines may not be practical. However, solid rocket engines have a limited burn time and cannot be restarted once ignited, making them less suitable for missions that require a precise control of thrust and burn time.</p>

This record of success has helped to establish China as a major player in the small satellite launch market and has positioned the Express Series as a top choice for satellite operators worldwide.</em></p>
<p><em>With the increasing demand for small satellite launches, the Express Series Launch Vehicle is poised to play an increasingly important role in the coming years. As the Chinese space program continues to grow and evolve, it is likely that the Express Series will continue to be refined and improved, providing even more capabilities and opportunities for satellite operators and owners.</em></p>
<p>The fast boat series launch vehicle is the first small launch vehicle in my country to be one of stars and arrows. It uses rudder control technology and has the characteristics of fast integration and fast orbit. It is mainly used in natural disaster emergencies and communication system failures, to achieve rapid satellite launch and space deployment, and to obtain information on the disaster situation in a timely manner to minimize disaster losses and organize relief in the event of a disaster.</p>
<p>The grid rudder is a rocket flight attitude control device. In the process of the rocket rushing up into the sky, the grid rudder is tightly attached to the rocket and does not work; when the rocket completes its mission and re-enters the atmosphere, the rudder of the grid will become “ Wings ” of the rocket wreckage. Under the escort of wings “ ”, the final wreckage of the rocket can fall in the set area. This will avoid the evacuation of residents at the landing zone, and will also lay the groundwork for controlled recovery, soft landing, and launch vehicle under-grade and follow-up booster reuse technologies.</p>

<p>Currently, most launch vehicles are liquid fuel launch vehicles, which have high costs and long preparation times. Fast boat rocket uses solid fuel and the main advantage is fast. Liquid rockets take more than 20 days from preparation to launch and solid rockets take only 24 hours from preparation to launch. Another advantage of solid fuel launch vehicles is that their volume is significantly small. At the same time, the launch vehicle of the fast boat series can be launched at the launch site in the inner space or by maneuvering on a large offshore platform, and the launch cost is greatly reduced. The main shortcomings at the moment are insufficient carrying capacity and the launch of large spacecraft is mainly based on a long series of rockets using liquid fuel.</p>

<p>A manned spacecraft is a spacecraft capable of protecting astronauts from living and working in space to perform space missions and return to earth. Manned spacecraft can perform space activities independently or as a ferry “ ” between the ground and the space station, and can also perform joint flights after docking with the space station or other spacecraft.</p>
<p>The Shenzhou spacecraft is a series of manned spacecraft developed by China itself. It was included in the national plan in 1992 and has reached or surpassed the international third-generation manned spacecraft technology. Manned spacecraft design is based on what tasks to perform or complete. The Shenzhou spacecraft uses a three cabin section, built from the return cabin, orbital cabin, propulsion cabin and additional sections.</p>
<p>The propulsion module, also known as the power module, provides energy and power for the regulation and return of the spacecraft&rsquo;s orbit. The return module is the astronauts&rsquo; cockpit during the ascent and return of the spacecraft, and it is also the command and control center for the entire spacecraft. The return module not only withstands various stress and environmental conditions during takeoff, climb and orbit phases like other cabins, but also prohibits overload deceleration and aerodynamic heating during reentry and return phases.</p>

<p>The Orbital Module is a workplace where astronauts conduct scientific experiments and technical experiments in spacecraft orbit. Contains various experimental tools and equipment. When the spaceship runs by itself, it is also the astronaut&rsquo;s life area. After leaving the main body of the spacecraft in the orbital compartment of the first Shenzhou spacecraft, it will remain in space to continue working for a period of time to provide ground personnel with scientific research data.</p>
<p>The additional paragraph is also called the transition paragraph, which exists on the first Shenzhou spacecraft, and is mainly used to complete the handover with other spacecraft. Also, other tools can be installed for space detection. Starting with the Shenzhou 7 spacecraft, the additional section has been replaced by a formal space docking agency.</p>
<p>The three segments will perform their functions during the independent flight of the Shenzhou spacecraft. When the Shenzhou spacecraft and the space station are docked to form a combination, the division of labor in the cabin will be adjusted. For example, after forming a combination, astronauts do not have to work and live in the orbital module.</p>

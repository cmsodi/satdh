<p>The above diagram is merely a schematic representation of the major aspects of remote sensing. This article will discuss a few them. However, it will also cover the future development trends of satellite remote sensing technology and the incorporation of remote sensing data into a variety of industries and fields. Finally, we will soon examine the significance of the high-resolution Earth observation satellite system in various nations.</p>
<h3 id="passive-and-active-remote-sensing">Passive and Active remote sensing</h3>
<p>There are two main types of remote sensing: passive remote sensing and active remote sensing.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Passive Remote Sensing:</strong> Passive remote sensing involves the detection of naturally occurring energy from the Earth&rsquo;s surface, such as visible light, infrared radiation, and microwave radiation. Passive remote sensors do not emit energy and simply detect the energy that is already present. Examples of passive remote sensing include the use of cameras for visible light imaging and infrared sensors for thermal imaging.</li>
<li><strong>Active Remote Sensing:</strong> Active remote sensing involves the emission of energy from the sensor towards the Earth&rsquo;s surface, and the detection of the reflected energy. Active remote sensing can provide higher resolution data compared to passive remote sensing, as the energy can be focused and directed towards specific areas. Examples of active remote sensing include radar and lidar systems.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p></br><figure>  <img src="sensors.png" alt="." style="width:100%">  <figcaption> <small> Credit: NASA Applied Remote Sensing Training Program&gt;</a> </small> </figcaption></figure></br></p>
<h3 id="sensor-types">Sensor types</h3>
<p>The sensors collect information in different forms, including electromagnetic radiation, such as visible light and infrared, as well as other forms of energy, such as radar and lidar.
In addition to these two main types of remote sensing, there are several subtypes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optical sensors</strong>: are sensors that measure the reflected or emitted energy in the visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples are Landsat-1, Sentinel, Planet Labs, Aqua, Aura, Cartosat, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Radar sensors</strong>: are sensors that emit microwave pulses and measure the backscattered signals from the earth’s surface. Examples are Seasat-1, RISAT, Cosmo-SkyMed, SARAL/AltiKa, etc.</li>
<li><strong>LiDAR sensors</strong>: are sensors that emit laser pulses and measure the time delay and intensity of the returned signals to derive elevation or distance information. Examples are ALMAZ-1, CryoSat-2, CALIPSO, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Thermal sensors</strong>: are sensors that that measure the emitted energy in the thermal infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. An example of a thermal sensor mentioned in the page is Aqua, which carries a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) that can detect land surface temperature and fire activity.</li>

<h2 id="remote-sensing-tools">Remote Sensing Tools</h2>
<h3 id="overview-of-remote-sensing-tools">Overview of Remote Sensing Tools</h3>
<p>Remote sensing tools are the instruments and platforms that are used to collect and analyze data from remote sources, such as satellites, aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles. These tools play a critical role in the remote sensing process, allowing scientists, researchers, and military personnel to gather the information they need to make informed decisions and solve complex problems.</p>
<h3 id="comparison-of-different-tools-used-in-remote-sensing">Comparison of Different Tools Used in Remote Sensing</h3>
<p>There are many different tools used in remote sensing, each with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most commonly used tools include satellite imaging systems, airborne remote sensing platforms, and ground-based remote sensing systems.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Satellite imaging systems</strong> are large, complex systems that are designed to capture high-resolution images and data from space. They are often used for large-scale mapping and monitoring projects, as well as for military reconnaissance and surveillance.</li>
<li><strong>Airborne remote sensing platforms</strong>, such as aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles, are designed to collect data from lower altitudes. They are often used for detailed mapping and monitoring of smaller areas, as well as for environmental and geological research.</li>
<li><strong>Ground-based remote sensing systems</strong> are typically used for monitoring and measuring environmental variables, such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. These systems are often smaller and less complex than satellite and airborne systems, but they can be more easily deployed in remote and challenging environments.</li>
</ul>
<p></br><figure>  <img src="Remote_sensing_of_coastal_and_marine_environment.webp.png" alt="." style="width:100%">  <figcaption> <small> Remote sensing of coastal and marine environment <a target=_blank  target="_blank" href=https://doi.org/10.3390%2Frs12142313><a href="https://doi.org/10.3390%2Frs12142313"   target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.3390%2Frs12142313</a>

</a> </small> </figcaption></figure></br></p>
<p>Ultimately, the choice of remote sensing tool will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific needs of the project, the type of data being collected, and the budget and resources available.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-and-advantages-of-remote-sensing-from-space">Benefits and advantages of Remote Sensing from space</h2>
<p>A short and simple summary can be helpful.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost-effectiveness:</strong> Remote sensing allows for the collection of data over large areas in a cost-effective manner, as the sensors can be  mounted on satellites or aircraft that can cover large areas quickly.  This can be much more cost-effective than traditional methods, such as  ground-based surveys, which can be time-consuming and expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Time-saving:</strong> Remote sensing can also save time compared to  traditional methods, as the data can be collected and analyzed quickly.  This allows for quicker decision-making and a more rapid response to  events, such as natural disasters or changes in land use.</li>
<li><strong>High resolution:</strong> Space-based remote sensing can provide  high-resolution data, as satellites can be equipped with advanced  sensors and imaging systems. This can provide detailed information about the Earth’s surface and environment.</li>
<li><strong>Global coverage:</strong> Space-based remote sensing provides global  coverage, as satellites can be positioned in orbit to provide coverage  of the entire Earth’s surface. This allows for the collection of data  from remote and inaccessible areas, such as the poles, deserts, and  oceans.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat coverage:</strong> Satellites can be programmed to revisit the same  area repeatedly, allowing for the collection of data at regular  intervals. This can be useful for monitoring changes over time, such as  the progression of a disaster or the growth of crops.</li>
<li><strong>All-weather capabilities:</strong> Space-based remote sensing can provide  data in all weather conditions, as satellites are not affected by  weather conditions on the ground. This can be useful for collecting data in areas with extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes or  wildfires.</li>
<li><strong>Unobstructed view:</strong> Space-based remote sensing provides an  unobstructed view of the Earth’s surface, as satellites are not affected by obstacles, such as trees and buildings, that can obstruct the view  from the ground or from an aircraft.</li>
<li><strong>Independence from ground infrastructure:</strong> Space-based remote sensing  is independent from ground infrastructure, as satellites do not rely on  ground-based systems for data collection and transmission. This makes it ideal for collecting data in remote and inaccessible areas where  ground-based infrastructure may not be available.</li>
</ul>

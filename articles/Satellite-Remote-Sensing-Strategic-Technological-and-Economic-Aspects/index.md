# Satellite Remote Sensing: Strategic, Technological, and Economic Aspects

## Introduction

Remote sensing refers to the process of acquiring information about an object or phenomenon from a distance. This information is collected using instruments or sensors that are mounted on platforms such as satellites, aircraft, or drones. The technology has revolutionized the way we study and understand our planet, as well as opened up new opportunities for research and application in a wide range of fields.

The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of satellite remote sensing, focusing on its strategic, technological, and economic aspects. We will explore how remote sensing works, the different types of remote sensing, and the benefits it provides. Additionally, we will delve into its applications in various industries and fields, including military, space science, and the construction of smart cities.

This article will discuss a few of the major aspects of remote sensing. However, it will also cover the future development trends of satellite remote sensing technology and the incorporation of remote sensing data into a variety of industries and fields. Finally, we will soon examine the significance of the high-resolution Earth observation satellite system in various nations.


### Passive and Active remote sensing

There are two main types of remote sensing: passive remote sensing and active remote sensing.

>- **Passive Remote Sensing:** Passive remote sensing involves the detection of naturally occurring energy from the Earth's surface, such as visible light, infrared radiation, and microwave radiation. Passive remote sensors do not emit energy and simply detect the energy that is already present. Examples of passive remote sensing include the use of cameras for visible light imaging and infrared sensors for thermal imaging.
>- **Active Remote Sensing:** Active remote sensing involves the emission of energy from the sensor towards the Earth's surface, and the detection of the reflected energy. Active remote sensing can provide higher resolution data compared to passive remote sensing, as the energy can be focused and directed towards specific areas. Examples of active remote sensing include radar and lidar systems.

### Sensor types

The sensors collect information in different forms, including electromagnetic radiation, such as visible light and infrared, as well as other forms of energy, such as radar and lidar.
Are some of the most common remote sensing sensors used for Earth observation from space,  with examples of satellites that use each type of sensor:

> - **Optical sensors** detect and measure reflected or emitted light from the Earth's surface. They are the most common type of remote sensing sensor, and are used for a wide variety of applications, including land cover mapping, vegetation monitoring, and disaster response. (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, MODIS)
> - **Radar sensors** emit radio waves and measure the reflected signal. They can be used to collect data in all weather conditions, including at night. Radar sensors are often used for applications such as sea ice monitoring, flood mapping, and ground-penetrating radar. (Sentinel-1, TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed)
> - **LiDAR sensors** measure the distance to the Earth's surface by emitting and measuring laser pulses. They can be used to create high-resolution 3D models of the Earth's surface. LiDAR sensors are often used for applications such as urban planning, forestry, and geology. (ICESat, TanDEM-X, GEDI)
> - **Thermal infrared sensors** measure the heat emitted from the Earth's surface. They can be used to identify hot spots, such as wildfires, and to monitor changes in land cover. Thermal infrared sensors are often used for applications such as fire detection, agriculture, and climate change research. (Landsat 8, Sentinel-3, Aqua)
> - **Multispectral sensors** collect data in multiple bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. This allows them to capture more information about the Earth's surface than single-band sensors. Multispectral sensors are often used for applications such as land cover mapping, vegetation monitoring, and crop health assessment. (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, MODIS)
> - **Hyperspectral sensors** collect data in hundreds of narrow bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. This allows them to create detailed spectral signatures of objects on the Earth's surface, which can be used for a variety of applications, such as material identification, crop stress detection, and environmental monitoring. (EnMAP, HyspIRI, Hyperion)

These are just a few of the many remote sensing sensors that are used for Earth observation from space. The type of sensor that is best suited for a particular application will depend on the specific needs of the user.

## Remote Sensing Equipments

There are many different equipments used in remote sensing, each with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. They can be components of satellite imaging systems, airborne remote sensing platforms, and ground-based remote sensing systems.

> - **Satellite imaging systems** are large, complex systems that are designed to capture high-resolution images and data from space. They are often used for large-scale mapping and monitoring projects, as well as for military reconnaissance and surveillance.
> - **Airborne remote sensing platforms**, such as aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles, are designed to collect data from lower altitudes. They are often used for detailed mapping and monitoring of smaller areas, as well as for environmental and geological research.
> - **Ground-based remote sensing systems** are typically used for monitoring and measuring environmental variables, such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. These systems are often smaller and less complex than satellite and airborne systems, but they can be more easily deployed in remote and challenging environments.

## Benefits and advantages of Remote Sensing from space

A short and simple summary can be helpful.


- **Cost-effectiveness:** Remote sensing allows for the collection of data over large areas in a cost-effective manner, as the sensors can be  mounted on satellites or aircraft that can cover large areas quickly.  This can be much more cost-effective than traditional methods, such as  ground-based surveys, which can be time-consuming and expensive.
- **Time-saving:** Remote sensing can also save time compared to  traditional methods, as the data can be collected and analyzed quickly.  This allows for quicker decision-making and a more rapid response to  events, such as natural disasters or changes in land use.
- **High resolution:** Space-based remote sensing can provide  high-resolution data, as satellites can be equipped with advanced  sensors and imaging systems. This can provide detailed information about the Earth’s surface and environment.
- **Global coverage:** Space-based remote sensing provides global  coverage, as satellites can be positioned in orbit to provide coverage  of the entire Earth’s surface. This allows for the collection of data  from remote and inaccessible areas, such as the poles, deserts, and  oceans.
- **Repeat coverage:** Satellites can be programmed to revisit the same  area repeatedly, allowing for the collection of data at regular  intervals. This can be useful for monitoring changes over time, such as  the progression of a disaster or the growth of crops.
- **All-weather capabilities:** Space-based remote sensing can provide  data in all weather conditions, as satellites are not affected by  weather conditions on the ground. This can be useful for collecting data in areas with extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes or  wildfires.
- **Unobstructed view:** Space-based remote sensing provides an  unobstructed view of the Earth’s surface, as satellites are not affected by obstacles, such as trees and buildings, that can obstruct the view  from the ground or from an aircraft.
- **Independence from ground infrastructure:** Space-based remote sensing  is independent from ground infrastructure, as satellites do not rely on  ground-based systems for data collection and transmission. This makes it ideal for collecting data in remote and inaccessible areas where  ground-based infrastructure may not be available.

# The Geopolitical Chessboard in Space: Navigating the Implications


## Introduction

Space exploration is a critical topic with worldwide interest. As it becomes more advanced and accessible, it has the potential to impact international relations, create new economic opportunities, and drive scientific advancements. However, there are also associated risks, such as conflict, environmental harm, and resource exploitation. Thus, a clear understanding of legal, political, and geopolitical frameworks is essential, including a unified strategic approach and consideration of sustainability concerns. This article explores the need for these frameworks to achieve a cooperative and sustainable future in space.

## Developing a Consistent Strategic Approach

### What is space geopolitics

The first step in navigating the geopolitical implications of space exploration is to understand the nature of geopolitics itself. Geopolitics is the study of the relationship between geography, politics, and international power dynamics. It involves analyzing the distribution of resources, trade routes, military bases, and other strategic factors that shape the international system.

In the context of space exploration, geopolitical factors include access to space launch facilities, control over strategic space assets such as satellites and space stations, and the ability to exploit space-based resources such as minerals and energy. Understanding these factors is crucial to navigating the complex and rapidly evolving landscape of space geopolitics.

### Political Framework

A political framework is necessary to ensure the long-term viability and security of space activities because the exploration of space poses a special set of challenges. In addition to addressing issues like space debris, resource exploitation, and space tourism, this regime should take a wide range of variables into account, including international treaties, norms, and best practices.

The political and legal framework for space exploration is significant for a number of reasons. In the first place, it offers a framework for spacefaring countries to cooperate and work together on space exploration and scientific projects, as well as a means of preventing disputes that could result from conflicting interests. Second, it helps to reduce risks to both people and the environment by ensuring that space activities are carried out in a safe and sustainable manner.

### Commercial Interest

In order to develop a consistent strategic approach to space exploration, several factors must be taken into account. The harmony between commercial and national interests is a significant factor. Commercial organizations are becoming more involved in space exploration and advancing technology, but their objectives may not align with those of governments, which may place a higher priority on scientific research and national security.

### Sustenaibility

Another factor to consider is sustainability. Space exploration has the potential to disrupt the environment in ways that are difficult to predict or mitigate. Space debris, for example, poses a significant risk to spacecraft and astronauts, and can create hazards for future space activities. Resource exploitation, such as the mining of asteroids, raises questions about property rights and the potential for environmental damage.

## Astropolitik, i.e., Space Geopolitics

"Astropolitik: Classical Geopolitics in the Space Age" is a book written by Everett C. Dolman that explores the political implications of space exploration and development. Space exploration is not just a scientific or technological endeavor but is also inherently political.

As space exploration becomes increasingly important, it is necessary to understand the potential geopolitical implications of this activity. Several theories from the field of geopolitics can be applied to space exploration, including the "Thucydides Trap" and "Great Power Competition".

### Thucydides Trap

According to "Thucydides Trap"  theory, when a new power confronts an established one, a conflict may result from the ensuing power struggle. This theory is relevant to space exploration since countries such as China are heavily investing in their space programs and challenging the long-established US-Russian space dominance. As these countries gain more capabilities and their interests in space expand, the risk of a power struggle and conflict increases. To avoid this trap, countries must develop a cooperative framework for space exploration that promotes mutual understanding and collaboration.

### Great Power Competition

Another theory that is relevant to space exploration is the idea of "Great Power Competition" . In the context of space, "great power competition" refers to the competition between countries seeking to establish themselves as dominant players in space. This competition could potentially lead to a new space race, with countries competing for resources, technology, and dominance. As tensions between countries rise, so does the risk of conflict.

### Scientific Collaboration Framework

Despite these risks, space exploration provides unique opportunities for international collaboration in scientific research and technology development, as well as joint exploration and resource utilization.. By promoting a cooperative framework for space exploration, countries can work together to advance space exploration while avoiding the risk of conflict.

## The Relevance of Superpower Confrontation in the Space Age

### The Space Race

The history of space exploration is inextricably linked to the Cold War and the Space Race between the US and the Soviet Union. The two superpowers developed their space programs and competed for milestones such as the first human in space, the first satellite, and the first moon landing in order to gain technological supremacy and military advantage. While this competition has largely driven rapid technological advancements, it has also increased the risk of conflict and contributed to an arms race, putting global security at risk.

### The potential for new players in space exploration

One potential scenario is the emergence of new spacefaring nations, particularly in Asia and Africa. These nations could bring new capabilities and perspectives to the exploration and exploitation of space, potentially shifting the balance of power in space geopolitics. This could present both opportunities and challenges for existing space powers, as they navigate the changing landscape of space exploration.

Another potential scenario is the continued growth of private space companies, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. These companies are rapidly developing new technologies and capabilities, and could play a significant role in shaping the future of space exploration. However, their role in space geopolitics is uncertain, and it remains to be seen how they will interact with existing spacefaring nations and international institutions.

### Space weaponization

Today, there is growing concern about a new space race between the United States, Russia, and China. The increasing militarization of space, the development of anti-satellite weapons, and competition for resources such as helium-3 on the moon could all contribute to a new space race. As tensions between these countries rise, space exploration may become yet another arena for geopolitical competition and confrontation.
Finally, space has become an important arena for espionage and intelligence gathering. The development of sophisticated surveillance technologies has made it possible for nations to gather intelligence from space-based platforms, such as satellites. This has the potential to undermine the privacy and security of nations and individuals, and could lead to increased tensions between nations.

### The Space forces

Several countries have established dedicated military branches or units for space-related activities, termed "space forces" by some. These countries are, in order of importance, the United States, Russia, and China, followed by India, France, and Japan. Other countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia, have stated that they intend to establish their own space forces in the near future. These space forces are in charge of a wide range of missions, including space situational awareness, satellite operations and defense, and potentially offensive space capabilities.

## Conclusions

The development of a consistent strategic approach to space exploration is critical for the long-term sustainability and safety of space activities. The legal and political regime for space exploration must balance commercial and national interests with sustainability and safety and take into account a wide range of factors, such as international treaties, norms, and best practices.

Applying geopolitical theories to the space age can help us understand the potential risks and opportunities of space exploration. The "Thucydides Trap" and "Great Power Competition" theories highlight the potential for conflict and competition in space.

The historical context of the Cold War and the Space Race highlights the risks of superpower confrontation in space exploration. The current risks of a new space race between the US, Russia, and China underscore the importance of promoting mutual understanding and collaboration to avoid conflict and advance space exploration in a safe and sustainable manner.

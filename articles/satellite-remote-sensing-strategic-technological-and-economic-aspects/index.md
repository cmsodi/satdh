### Passive and Active remote sensing

There are two main types of remote sensing: passive remote sensing and active remote sensing.

>- **Passive Remote Sensing:** Passive remote sensing involves the detection of naturally occurring energy from the Earth's surface, such as visible light, infrared radiation, and microwave radiation. Passive remote sensors do not emit energy and simply detect the energy that is already present. Examples of passive remote sensing include the use of cameras for visible light imaging and infrared sensors for thermal imaging.
>- **Active Remote Sensing:** Active remote sensing involves the emission of energy from the sensor towards the Earth's surface, and the detection of the reflected energy. Active remote sensing can provide higher resolution data compared to passive remote sensing, as the energy can be focused and directed towards specific areas. Examples of active remote sensing include radar and lidar systems.

### Sensor types

The sensors collect information in different forms, including electromagnetic radiation, such as visible light and infrared, as well as other forms of energy, such as radar and lidar.
In addition to these two main types of remote sensing, there are several subtypes, including:

>- **Optical Remote Sensing:** Optical remote sensing involves the detection of visible light and near-infrared radiation. Optical remote sensing is used for applications such as mapping, land cover analysis, and crop monitoring.
>- **Radar Remote Sensing:** Radar remote sensing involves the use of radio waves to detect and map the Earth's surface. Radar remote sensing is used for applications such as mapping, land cover analysis, and disaster management.
>- **Thermal Remote Sensing:** Thermal remote sensing involves the detection of thermal infrared radiation, which is emitted by the Earth's surface. Thermal remote sensing is used for applications such as monitoring crop health, detecting forest fires, and mapping urban heat islands.
>- **Lidar Remote Sensing:** Lidar remote sensing involves the use of laser light to detect and map the Earth's surface. Lidar remote sensing is used for applications such as mapping, land cover analysis, and surveying.

## Remote Sensing Tools

### Overview of Remote Sensing Tools

Remote sensing tools are the instruments and platforms that are used to collect and analyze data from remote sources, such as satellites, aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles. These tools play a critical role in the remote sensing process, allowing scientists, researchers, and military personnel to gather the information they need to make informed decisions and solve complex problems.

### Comparison of Different Tools Used in Remote Sensing

There are many different tools used in remote sensing, each with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most commonly used tools include satellite imaging systems, airborne remote sensing platforms, and ground-based remote sensing systems.

>- **Satellite imaging systems** are large, complex systems that are designed to capture high-resolution images and data from space. They are often used for large-scale mapping and monitoring projects, as well as for military reconnaissance and surveillance.
>- **Airborne remote sensing platforms**, such as aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles, are designed to collect data from lower altitudes. They are often used for detailed mapping and monitoring of smaller areas, as well as for environmental and geological research.
>- **Ground-based remote sensing systems** are typically used for monitoring and measuring environmental variables, such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. These systems are often smaller and less complex than satellite and airborne systems, but they can be more easily deployed in remote and challenging environments.

## Benefits and advantages of Remote Sensing from space

A short and simple summary can be helpful.

<div style="background-color:lightyellow;">


- **Cost-effectiveness:** Remote sensing allows for the collection of data over large areas in a cost-effective manner, as the sensors can be  mounted on satellites or aircraft that can cover large areas quickly.  This can be much more cost-effective than traditional methods, such as  ground-based surveys, which can be time-consuming and expensive.
- **Time-saving:** Remote sensing can also save time compared to  traditional methods, as the data can be collected and analyzed quickly.  This allows for quicker decision-making and a more rapid response to  events, such as natural disasters or changes in land use.
- **High resolution:** Space-based remote sensing can provide  high-resolution data, as satellites can be equipped with advanced  sensors and imaging systems. This can provide detailed information about the Earthâ€™s surface and environment.
- **Global coverage:** Space-based remote sensing provides global  coverage, as satellites can be positioned in orbit to provide coverage  of the entire Earthâ€™s surface. This allows for the collection of data  from remote and inaccessible areas, such as the poles, deserts, and  oceans.
- **Repeat coverage:** Satellites can be programmed to revisit the same  area repeatedly, allowing for the collection of data at regular  intervals. This can be useful for monitoring changes over time, such as  the progression of a disaster or the growth of crops.
- **All-weather capabilities:** Space-based remote sensing can provide  data in all weather conditions, as satellites are not affected by  weather conditions on the ground. This can be useful for collecting data in areas with extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes or  wildfires.
- **Unobstructed view:** Space-based remote sensing provides an  unobstructed view of the Earthâ€™s surface, as satellites are not affected by obstacles, such as trees and buildings, that can obstruct the view  from the ground or from an aircraft.
- **Independence from ground infrastructure:** Space-based remote sensing  is independent from ground infrastructure, as satellites do not rely on  ground-based systems for data collection and transmission. This makes it ideal for collecting data in remote and inaccessible areas where  ground-based infrastructure may not be available.

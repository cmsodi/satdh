      <description>China&amp;rsquo;s Space Launchers https://historicspacecraft.com/Rockets_Chinese.html#:~:text=Chinese%20Rockets%20Overview&amp;text=Chinese%20orbital%20launches%20currently%20originate,Space%20Launch%20Center%20(WSLC).
Introduction China&amp;rsquo;s aerospace industry was established in the mid-1950s and now has a complete R &amp;amp; D and production system in space transportation.
The Long March series of launch vehicles was developed from China&amp;rsquo;s ballistic missile and sounding rocket technologies, and can be used to launch various spacecraft including satellites, manned spacecraft, and moon exploration vehicles. The Long March 5 is a large launch vehicle designed for large payloads, while the Long March 7 is a medium-sized launch vehicle for cargo spacecraft. The Long March 11 is a four-stage solid launch vehicle mainly used for emergency launches. The Express series launch vehicle is China&amp;rsquo;s first small launch vehicle designed for fast integration and orbit, and is mainly used for emergency launches in natural disasters. The grid rudder technology is used to control the flight attitude of the rocket and ensure controlled landing.
The Long March 1 is a three-stage rocket that is primarily used to launch small spacecraft into low Earth orbit.</description>
